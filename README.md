# **Musicianâ€™s Songbook**

This is a simple application to address an issue that most musicians face while practicing. Even as music evolves and musicians learn new compositions, it is imperative that they practice both newly learnt previously learnt compositions regularly. However, as the number of compositions learnt by the musician increases, it becomes harder to keep track of compositions being practiced manually. This project aims at helping create a database that is easily able to group compositions according to genre, date learnt and date last practiced. The user has the option to add names of new compositions to his/her songbook, edit previously present items and also delete items in case he/she needs to.
