# **Requirements**
## **Introduction**
The Musician's Songbook is a simple project that aims at helping a musician create a database of compositions he/she has learnt and allows them to keep track of these compositions and practice accordingly.
This is a fairly simple project that would help musicians keep up with their practice sessions of previously learnt compositions. This is usually hard for most musicians due to the sheer number of compositions that they learn in a lifetime. It sometimes becomes hard to remember and keep track of items that have been practiced and those that have not. 

This project is being implemented using C Programming Language. 

## **Features**
* It allows the user to add compositions into the database - which from here on shall be referred to as songbook. 
* The user can edit and/or delete the entries in the songbook to update it. 
* The user has the option to define different genres and also group compositions into the genres he sees fit.
* To make the database more structured and easily understandable, each composition can be assigned an ID which is a an abbrievation of the song name or anything unique that the user wants it to be.
* Dates can be assigned by the user to each composition to signify when the composition was first learnt and also when it was last practiced. This would allow the user to keep up with his practice sessions more diligently.
* Finally, the entire database can be viewed by the user and would be extremely user friendly as opposed to a tedious manual list of compositions which would be hard to organise and keep track of.
